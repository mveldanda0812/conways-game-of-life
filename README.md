# conways-game-of-life
Please use the ConwaysGameOfLife.jar executable jar to run the program.

1) Improved Result Display:
		Developed a GUI to make the program interactive and visualize the output efficiently. 
		The state of the individual cell can be altered by clicking on the respective cell.
		
2) Loop through states: updated state becomes initial state and recalculates.
		An update button is available on the GUI to easily calculate updated state and make it as the initial state.
		
3) Emphasis on performance:
		The entire grid is initially read cell by cell to prepare the initial state.
		Optimized loops and conditions to improve performance.
